# Spring

Welcome to `Los traineeÂ´s` Spring starter kit repository!


If you are not familiar with Spring, please complete the [Spring Quickstart Guide](https://spring.io/quickstart).

This repo contains two Spring demo projects which will  help you getting started with this framework!

First, `new-project` folder contains an empty project created with [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/). *Spring Web*, *Spring Data JPA* and *PostgreSQL Driver* dependencies are included, so you don't need to worry about that. Feel free to use it in your project!

*PD: Spring Data JPA dependency is initially commented in the `pom.xml` file because it's currently not being used. Be sure to uncomment it once you start coding your JPA implementation*

Second, `demo-project` folder contains the project shown in our demo. In it, you will find a Spring project implementation for a specific problem.

Now, you're ready to start your own project ðŸš€

Good Luck!
